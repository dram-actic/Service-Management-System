# Service-Management-System
The Service Management System, built with Java, SpringBoot, Gradle, JPA, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Tomcat Server, and Angular.JS, enables customers to register electrical appliances, create service requests, and track them. Admins manage tickets, update statuses, and assign technicians. Technicians log in to view and update assigned tickets.
