# Service management System

The Service Management System project utilizes various technologies, including Java, SpringBoot, Gradle, JPA, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Tomcat Server, and Angular.JS. It provides a comprehensive solution for customers to sign up, register their electrical appliances, and create service requests for repairs. Customers can also track the progress of their service requests.

The system includes an admin section where administrators can view all the service request tickets raised by customers. Admins have the ability to update the status of the tickets and assign technicians to handle them.

Furthermore, there is a dedicated technician login page where technicians can access a list of service requests assigned to them. Technicians can update the status of these requests, ensuring efficient communication and tracking within the system.


## To run an Angular project using Git, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from Git using the git clone command.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Run npm install to install the project's dependencies.
5. Once the dependencies are installed, execute the ng serve command to start the Angular development server.
6. Open a web browser and navigate to the provided local server address (usually http://localhost:4200) to view your Angular application.

Remember to keep the Git repository updated with changes using commands such as git add, git commit, and git push to manage and track your project's codebase effectively.
## To run a Java project using Gradle and an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ with Git, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from Git using the git clone command.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ) by selecting the project's root directory.
3. Ensure that Gradle is installed on your system, either as a standalone installation or as a plugin within the IDE.
4. Once the project is imported, Gradle will automatically download the required dependencies defined in the build.gradle file.
5. Build the project using the Gradle build command (gradlew build or gradle build) either from the command line or through the IDE's Gradle plugin.
6. After the project is built successfully, run the application by executing the main class or by using the IDE's run configuration.
7. The application will start, and you can interact with it through the specified entry points in the code.

Remember to keep your Git repository up to date by committing and pushing your changes using Git commands (git add, git commit, and git push). This allows you to track and collaborate on your Java project effectively.
